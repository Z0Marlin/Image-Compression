# Image-Compression

## Instructions for testing

- **Before running the program** create a folder named ```temp``` and  copy the image files from ```resources``` to ```temp```.

- To run the program enter ```python3 Starter.py``` in command line.

- The output image will be placed in the ```temp``` folder.

- The extent of compression can be adjusted by changing the value of `DEVIATION_THRESHOLD` in the file `Quadtree.py`. `DEVIATION THRESHOLD` lies in the range `[0,1]` with `1` being max compression and `0` being least.
